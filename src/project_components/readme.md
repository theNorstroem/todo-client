# project_components
Put your reusable project components in this folder. 

It is absolute OK, to create a component in a project first. But sometimes you need a component in different places. 

Creating the project components in this folder will make it easier for your fuutre self to move them in to a separate,  installable component 
(if you want to use it in more then one project). Copying component in to an ohter project works, but this will cause a
lot of maintenance work for you.

The furo element generator can help you to create a installable component.

Learn more about the generator [here](https://furo.pro/guide/md/starterpacks/).
