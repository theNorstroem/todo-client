# project_components
Put your reusable project components in this folder. 

It is absolute OK, to create a component in a project first. 
But consider to move the component to its own package, so others can install and use them too.


Creating the project components in this folder will make it easier for your fuutre self to move them in to a separate,  installable component 
(if you want to use it in more then one project). 

Copying a component in to an ohter project works to, but this will cause a
lot of maintenance work for you **NOT RECOMENDED**.
